# -Chromosomes-classification
Implement Feed forward Back propagation Neural Network to classify the chromosomes.
#  Goals:
Display image for the 24 chromosomes with distinguishable colors using
MATLAB (R2015a), 64-bit (win64), hp pro 450G laptop, Windows 10 Pro, Processor
Intel® Core™ i7-7500U, CPU 2.70GHZ, RAM 8.00 GB.
When chromosomes are exposed to the spectrum they either absorb or reflect it. Based on
this idea we can represent absorption by (0) and reflection by (1). That each chromosome
has a unique behavior for a combination of spectrums, thus we can distinguish it.
